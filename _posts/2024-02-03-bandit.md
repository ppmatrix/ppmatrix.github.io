## Walkthrough
[https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

## Level 0
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

### MyWalk

As the description:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
{: .nolineno }

## Level 1
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

### MyWalk

As the description:

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 Oct  5 06:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 70 root    root    4096 Oct  5 06:20 ..

```
{: .nolineno }

```bash
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
{: .nolineno }

## Level 2
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

### MyWalk

This type of approach has a lot of misunderstanding because using - as an argument refers to STDIN/STDOUT i.e dev/stdin or dev/stdout .So if you want to open this type of file you have to specify the full location of the file such as ./- .For eg. , if you want to see what is in that file use cat ./-

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls -al
total 24
-rw-r-----  1 bandit2 bandit1   33 Oct  5 06:19 -
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 Oct  5 06:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 70 root    root    4096 Oct  5 06:20 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root     220 Jan  6  2022 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root    3771 Jan  6  2022 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root     807 Jan  6  2022 .profile
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi
```
{: .nolineno }

Another way is using redirection:
```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat < -
rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi

```
{: .nolineno }

Also using the **rev** command.  
The rev utility copies the specified files to standard output, reversing the order of characters in every line.  
So this shows what's in the file in the correct order:
```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ rev - | rev
rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi
```
{: .nolineno }
