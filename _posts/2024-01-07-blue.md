## Walkthrough
[https://tryhackme.com/room/blue](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue)

**Difficulty level:** Easy

## Task 1: Recon
Scan and learn what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up. This room is not meant to be a boot2root CTF, rather, this is an educational series for complete beginners. Professionals will likely get very little out of this room beyond basic practice as the process here is meant to be beginner-focused.


### Questions

Q1. Scan the machine. (If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the Nmap room)

> "no answer needed"

Q2. How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?

> "3"

Q3. What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)

> "ms17-010"


### MyWalk

mywalk_description

```bash
nmap -T4 -sC -sV -Pn -oN nmap/initial 10.10.40.46
```
{: .nolineno }

Following the tip on Q1, about using some nmap scripting is very useful:

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.10.40.46
```
{: .nolineno }

We have now the answers to our questions above.
