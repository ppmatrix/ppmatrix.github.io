## Walkthrough
[https://tryhackme.com/room/blue](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue)

**Difficulty level:** Easy

## Task 1: Recon
Scan and learn what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up. This room is not meant to be a boot2root CTF, rather, this is an educational series for complete beginners. Professionals will likely get very little out of this room beyond basic practice as the process here is meant to be beginner-focused.


### Questions

Q1. Scan the machine. (If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the Nmap room)

> "no answer needed"

Q2. How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?

> "3"

Q3. What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)

> "ms17-010"


### MyWalk

Usually go with this scan...

```bash
nmap -T4 -sC -sV -Pn -oN nmap/initial 10.10.40.46
```
{: .nolineno }

But following the tip on Q1, about using some nmap scripting is very useful in this case:

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.10.40.46
```
{: .nolineno }

We have now the answers to our questions above.

## Task 2: Gain Access

Exploit the machine and gain a foothold.

### Questions

Q1. Start Metasploit

> "No answer needed"

Q2. Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)

> "exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue"

Q3. Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)

> "RHOSTS"

Q4. Usually it would be fine to run this exploit as is; however, for the sake of learning, you should do one more thing before exploiting the target. Enter the following command and press enter:

```bash
set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
```
{: .nolineno }

With that done, run the exploit!

Q4. "No answer needed"

Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot of the target. 

Q5. "No answer needed"
